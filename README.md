# Avalon Companion App

This is a companion app I built for the Avalon board game. It is used to keep track of time per round. It is usable on any Android operating system (8.0 and above).

## How to Install

To install the app, simply download the [apk](AvalonCompanionApp.apk) onto the mobile device and tap to install.

To recompile from source, download Android Studio and open the project. Then, follow Android's Studio instructions to compile and build to an apk.

## How to Use

The Game Setup screen allows the user to indicate the number of players and which roles are in the game. This screen is mainly used to do the night phase.

During the main phase of the game, my group uses a set of timers. The way these timers work is as follows: 
* Public discussion lasting a number of minutes equal to the number of people on the mission, 
* Thirty seconds where the king may explain his reasoning, and only the king may speak. 

After that, the mission is voted on, and either rejected or not. The app reflects this by allowing the user to indicate whether the previous mission was rejected, Succeeded, or Failed.
